# Space-Invanders-C-Clone
After doing the codes of the previous games, I encourage myself to make/clone a game. I took Space Invaders because it was classic and didn't need a look of matrix like a Chess. I ended up making matrix anyway. The game have a pretty bad AI but It restores everything you kill all the aliens. Also, when you kill an Alien, you get one point.  You could see your score always in the screen.  Move with 'a' to the left and with 'd' to the right. Shoot with space.
